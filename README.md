# Task-Management-Project
My project aims to develop a robust and user friendly Task Management system to streamline workflow. The system will provide a centralized platform for users to create, assign, track, and manage tasks efficiently. It will cater to individuals, teams, and organizations of all sizes, offering a flexible and scalable solution.

This Python-based task management system is a users efficiently organize and prioritize their tasks. It leverages fundamental programming
concepts such as loops and operators to provide a user-friendly interface for creating, viewing,
editing, and deleting tasks
This Python-based task management system is a command-line application designed to help users efficiently organize and prioritize their tasks. It utilizes fundamental programming concepts such as lists, dictionaries, and functions to create a user-friendly interface for managing tasks.

Code Working:
 * Data Structure:
   * A list or dictionary is used to store task information. Each task is represented as a tuple or a dictionary containing fields like description, due date, and priority.
 * Input/Output:
   * The input() function is used to get user input.
   * The print() function is used to display information on the console.
 * Loops:
   * while loops are used to create the main menu and repeat actions until the user exits.
   * for loops are used to iterate over task lists and perform operations on each task.
 * Conditional Statements:
   * if, elif, and else statements are used to make decisions based on user input and taskÂ conditions.
